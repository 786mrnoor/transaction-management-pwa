To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

# Bold

To bold text, add two **asterisks** or __underscores__ before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for em**phas**is, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

# Italic

To italicize text, add one *asterisk* or _underscore_ before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for e*mphas*is, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

# Bold and Italic

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three ***asterisks*** or ___underscores___ before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

# Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a **>** in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

# Nested Blockquotes
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a **>>** in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

# Blockquotes with Other Elements
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
>

# Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

5. # Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item
